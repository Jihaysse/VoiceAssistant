# VoiceAssistant
A French voice assistant called "Ava" I made using Python 3 and (many) libraries.

Its current features are:
- Search on Youtube (ex: to play a song as Spotify doesn't allow to play the full songs using their API).
- Search on Google
- Search on Wikipedia
- Search for the distance between 2 cities

As I decided to learn new skills (C# and Swift), I won't be able to work on this project in the foreseeable future.
Feel free to add features or use it for your own projects.
